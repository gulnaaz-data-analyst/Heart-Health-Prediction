## Description

This project aims to develop a comprehensive health prediction system using advanced machine learning models. The system integrates multiple approaches to handle diverse types of health-related data and provide accurate predictions.

### Models Utilized:

1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - DenseNet**:
   - Used for processing and analyzing image data.
   - Leverages dense connections between layers to improve efficiency and accuracy.

2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) - LSTM**:
   - Employed for handling sequential data such as time-series health records.
   - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units help in capturing long-term dependencies in the data.

3. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Serves as a baseline model.
   - Provides interpretable results and is used for comparative analysis with more complex models.

### Objectives:

- To predict health outcomes by analyzing various forms of health data.
- To combine the strengths of CNN, RNN, and logistic regression models for robust predictions.
- To explore the effectiveness of deep learning models in the healthcare domain.
- To provide a framework that can be extended for various health prediction tasks.

### Key Features:

- **Multi-Model Approach**: Utilizes CNN for image data, LSTM for sequential data, and logistic regression for baseline predictions.
- **Data Processing**: Includes comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering steps to ensure high-quality inputs for the models.
- **Evaluation and Analysis**: Provides detailed evaluation metrics and analysis to compare model performances and interpret the results.

This health prediction system aims to aid in early diagnosis and personalized healthcare by leveraging the power of machine learning and deep learning techniques.
